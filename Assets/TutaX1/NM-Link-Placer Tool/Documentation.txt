========NM_Link_Placer========
-This tool allows you to quickly place navmesh links into your scene.
-The tool is all contained in the "NM_Link_Placer.cs" script.

***How to use?***
    -add the "NM_Link_Placer.cs" script as a component to an empty gameobject that 
    will store the navmesh links.
    -To begin placing the navmesh links, you must turn on "Create-Link-Mode".
        -You can turn "Create-Link-Mode" on or off by pressing the "Create-Link-Mode"
        button in the inspector.
        -You can also turn "Create-Link-Mode" on by pressing "Ctrl+L".
        -You can also turn "Create-Link-Mode" off by pressing the "Escape" key.
    -Once "Create-Link-Mode" is on, you can create and place a navmesh link in just
    two left-mouse clicks in the scene.
        -The first click sets the starting point for the navmesh link.
        -The second click sets the end point for the navmesh link and then instantiates
        the navmesh link using the navmesh link prefab.
    -You can easily change the settings of the NM links you will place by changing them in 
    the inspector of the the game object of this tool.
        -Settings include the NM link's parent game object, width, cost modifier, area type,
        agent type, and if it is bidirectional. The default parent game object is the game 
        object of this tool.

***Notes***
    -**IMPORTANT**: Many of the actions described above must be done with the editor 
    focused on the Scene view window and must be using the View tool (shortcut 'Q').
    -If you have set the start point for a navmesh link and not the endpoint, and then 
    turn "Create-Link-Mode" off, that navmesh link is canceled.
    -When adding the "NM_Link_Placer" component to an object, it will also add a 
    NavmeshSurface component as well by design so that the scene shows the gizmos
    for the navmesh and the navmesh links you place. I recommend keeping the NavmeshSurface
    component, but disabling/setting it inactive.
    -This tool was developed using Unity 2021.3.3f1.

***Demo***
    -I created a demo scene in the Demo folder with a simple environment, a third person 
    player, and an enemy. 
    -The scene has a baked navmesh (using the AI -> Navigation window) and the enemy has a
    navmeshAgent component. The enemy also has a script that sets the player as its target, 
    so it will hunt you down.
    -I created a gameobject called "Navmesh Links" with the "NM_Link_Placer" component. You 
    can see it already has some navmesh links created around the scene as its children.
    -Some of the navmesh links you can see in the scene also created using the 
    AI -> Navigation window.

***Tips/more notes***
    -Along side this tool, you can use the AI -> Navigation window to bake a navmesh and 
    bake some off-mesh links (basically navmesh links) automatically. The off-mesh links the
    create automatically are only for allowing navmesh agents to drop down from things and 
    jump from one thing to another that have the same y-position. 
    -Along side this tool, you can also use a tool I found online which automatically 
    generates navmesh links. It does not always work like you need it to, hence why I created 
    a manual-placer tool. Here is a link to where you can find some information about it.
    https://forum.unity.com/threads/navmesh-links-generator-for-navmeshcomponents.515143/
    -In the demo/scripts, there is a script called "AgentLinkMover.cs" that you can place on 
    a navmesh agent as a component and allows you to select and edit the way it moves when 
    crossing navmesh links. When in playMode, this generates an faulty error that I believe
    needs to be fixed by Unity (I think). I got this script from the navmesh components git 
    repo     https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents
    -The baked navmesh data generated using the AI -> Navigation window is stored in a
    folder with the same name as the scene the navmesh belongs to.
